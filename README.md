# Introduction
    Python is an interpreter language, where the entire code is checked line by
    line, the interpreter(cpython) converts source code into byte code and then runs that byte code in cpython vm and again converts into machine code and runs in our host machine.

    Python3 comes with the major breaking changes from Python2, now Python2 
    community support is completely broken and official security updates for python2 has completely stopped, so it is recommended to use Python3 now.
